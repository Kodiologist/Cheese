<p><strong>You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study.</strong>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to see which of several desserts people find most appealing. The data will be used to design future research.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>Should you choose to participate, you will be shown pictures and descriptions of some desserts and asked which you like best. You will be asked to make three such choices.

<h2>Risks, costs, and benefits</h2>
<p>I foresee no risks, costs to you, or benefits that may arise from your participation in this study.

<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>There is a monetary reward assigned to the Human Intelligence Task (HIT) you have accepted. You will receive this reward after completing the HIT provided that, in my estimation, you answered my questions thoughtfully, honestly, and manually (i.e. without having a computer program complete the task for you), and you did not attempt the experiment more than once.

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>I will never ask for personally identifying information. Your Worker ID and IP address will be omitted from any public releases of the experimental data.

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your participation in this study is voluntary: you don't have to be in this study if you don't want to be.
<li>You have the right to change your mind and leave the study (by selecting "Return HIT") at any time without giving any reason.
<li>Any new information that may make you change your mind about being in this study will be given to you.
